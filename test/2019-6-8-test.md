# Testing the Map

We see the world as fundamentally improved by technology. However, technology does not in itself solve problems. All too often, improvements for the richest facets of society do not reach the poor. Despite the ubiquity of smart phones in the industrialized world, more than 1/2 of the global population does not have even basic access to the Internet. As of 2016, [The International Telephone Union](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2016.pdf), in it's annual report on the matter, showed that only 48% of the world has access to the Internet. As you might expect, that also falls along traditional lines of class, race, and gender. While 75% of Africans are unconnected to the 'Net, only 21% of Europeans are. Women are 12% more likely to be without access than men. Only 16% of people in less developed countries use the Internet while rural folks are almost twice as likely to be without access when compared to their urban counterparts.

To solve that, we have to think in ways that are anti-oppressive, intersectional, and explicitly aware of privilege. We can look to projects like One Laptop per Child which, with good intentions, was unable to solve the crises of poverty. According to [The World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/one-laptop-per-child-is-not-improving-reading-or-math-but-are-we-learning-enough-from-these-evaluati) recognizes that despite 10s of millions of distributed laptops, giving children out-of-context technology does not improve their math or reading scores. Certainly, standardized test scores are not the end-all, be-all of education metrics, but they are all we have. The only thing that OLPC did improve was the children's engagement with technology. This is should be obvious--giving children computers makes them more familiar with computers. What it doesn't do, however, is change anything structurally.
